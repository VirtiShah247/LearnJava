-> Elements level proportions are not applicable to array level proportion.
E.g. int[] a=new int[5];
     char[] b=new char[5];
     a = b;         // This is not valid
     int[]c = b;         // This is valid

-> Whenever we are assigning one array to another array, only reference variables will be reassigned and not underlined elements.
   Hence, type must be matched not size.
